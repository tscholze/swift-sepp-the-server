## What's Sepp
Sepp is a playground to experiment with Swift outside of Apple's App ecosystem. Due to the hard work of [Dunkelstern](https://github.com/dunkelstern), this is actual quite easy and it is perfect for beginners. 

Sepp has no features, no roadmap and has no life expectancy. He's just a new friend for long dark winter nights. But I like him.

## Features
1. It compiles
1. At the moment, Sepp does only provide a simple dir listing and rendering stuff

## How to run
1. Change the settings of the `SeppSettings.swift` file
1. Create the folder that was set as working directory
1. Add content to the folder
1. Build and run the application
1. Click after starting the server on `Open Browser`
1. Enjoy
